BU_Brain
========

A simple app that interfaces with Binghamton University's BU Brain portal. 

Currently it only does one thing, but does it well: it retrieves that pesky BU Number that everyone needs to get anything done on campus. 

Stay tuned for lots more features. This is a open source project if you wish to contribute. 

Just as a heads up, if you are not a Binghamton University student or faculty, this app will be useless for you
